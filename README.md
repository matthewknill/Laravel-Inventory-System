# Inventory System in Laravel

This is an incomplete Inventory System built in Laravel!

It currently supports:

- Inventory - CRUD operations on items
- Purchase Orders - CRUD operations
- Locations - CRUD operations
- Products - CRUD operations

This is essentially a front-end to the database structure outlined in `Inventory EER Diagram.png`.

Again, this is incomplete so use at your own risk.

I will likely not contribute much further to the development of this project. However, I am more than happy if anyone else would like to contribute.
